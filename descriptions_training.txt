Colour raster copies of so called Imperial Obligatory Imprints of the Stable Cadastre 1:2880 - <entity type=place uri=null>Bohemia</entity>. These maps originate in <entity type=date uri=null>1826-1843</entity> and originally were intended for archiving in the Central Archive of Cadastre of Lands in <entity type=place uri=null>Vienna</entity>. After declaration of the <entity type=place uri=null>Czechoslovak</entity> Republic they were handed over to <entity type=place uri=null>Prague</entity> in frame of separation of archives. In contrast to so called Original Maps of Stable Cadastre they record the original state of landscape without drawings of later changes. Up to now they belong to the most demanded and to the most used Archival documents of the Central Archive of Surveying and Cadastre. There are approximately 8400 cadastral maps in approx. 31 thousands map sheets for the territory of Bohemia. In cadastral districts where these maps were not retained, these maps are being continuously replaced by original maps of the stable cadastre.

<p>This dataset provides information for <entity type=place uri=null>Cambridgeshire</entity> , <entity type=place uri=null> West Suffolk</entity> and <entity type=place uri=null>Peterborough</entity>, showing the age of homes as provided by the Valuation Office Agency, based on council tax records.<br />\nThe first file of data is specifically focussed on identifying homes with solid walls, as part of the <entity type=keyword uri=null>Warm Homes project</entity> , so the data has been grouped to highlight the small areas (known as Lower Super Output Areas) where homes fall into three specific age bands:<br />\nBuilt before 1929<br />\nBuilt between <entity type=date uri=null>1930 to 1939</entity> <br />\nBuilt between <entity type=date uri=null>1945 and 2015</entity> </p>\n<p>Some build dates are unknown, there are also counted in the data.</p>\n<p>Homes built before <entity type=date uri=null>1929</entity> all tend to have solid walls, as cavity walls had not been invented. Homes built between <entity type=date uri=null>1930 and 1939</entity> may or may not have solid walls, in the period when cavity walls were becoming more popular but not yet \"the norm\". Few homes were built <entity type=date uri=null>1939 to 1945</entity> . On the whole, homes built since <entity type=date uri=null>1945</entity> tend to have cavity walls.</p>\n<p>So this data set helps us identify where we can find homes which are most likely to have solid walls, and therefore where a solid wall insulation project might want ot focus its attention.</p>\n<p>The second data file is more detailed and adds further information on the date homes were built, grouped into ten-year bands, and adds the number of homes in each LSO which falls into council tax bands A to H as well.</p>\n

Overland flow data and soil water tension data at 10cm, 30cm, & 50cm from four manipulation plot sites located across the <entity type=place uri=null>Pontbren</entity> study site in mid-Wales, <entity type=place uri=null>UK</entity> .\nThe manipulation plots were established at different locations across the site between <entity type=date uri=null>2005-2012</entity> as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. Manipulation plot sites were located on improved grassland hillslopes and each site had three replicate plots. Following baseline monitoring different land use treatments were applied to individual plots. The different treatments were grazing (i.e. the control or no change), ungrazed and ungrazed with planting of trees. Details of the treatments can be found in the Pontbren Catchment Study Data Catalogue.\nOverland flow from a 10m x 2.5m isolated plot was measured within each treatment plot at each of the manipulation plot sites. Overland flow data were measured using tipping bucket monitoring systems and the number of tips occurring in a given time period recorded. Soil water tension (cm H2O) data were measured in each treatment plot using an array of tensiometers installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth.\nThe dataset contains four folders relating to the four manipulation plot sites. Within each folder are subfolders for overland flow runoff and soil water tension. Data are provided as text files and generally split into six-month blocks.\nNeutron probe access tubes were also installed in each of the manipulation plots to measure volumetric moisture content (cm3 cm-3) and two of the manipulation plots sites (1 and 4) also had rain gauges installed monitoring precipitation. The data thus collected are also available from the <entity type=keyword uri=null>Environmental Information Data Centre</entity> .
