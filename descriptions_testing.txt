<entity type=keyword uri=null>Local nature conservation sites</entity> (LNCS) is a non-statutory designation given by local authorities to areas of locally important nature and landscapes. Scottish Natural Heritage, on behalf of the Local Nature Conservation Sites Working Group, published guidance (http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/protected-areas/local-designations/local-nature-conservation/) for local authorities on the establishment and management of LNCS systems in <entity type=place uri=null>Scotland</entity>. \n\nOne of the LNCS working group's recommendations was that all local authorities should adopt the LNCS name in place of the many different local names. However, many councils still use alternative names for these sites such as Local Biodiversity Sites, Local Wildlife Sites, Local Geodiversity Sites and Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation. We have merged these all into this national dataset.\n\nSeveral LAs are still to confirm and digitise their LNCSs.
